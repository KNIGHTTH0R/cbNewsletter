## Work in progress
This still is a work in progress, approaching testing stage.<br>
You're welcome for contributing or testing though! :o)<br>


### ToDo:
* archivate sent newsletters
* admin UI:
  * protect admin dir with .htaccess/.htpasswd + add UI accordingly
    (not so sure this is practical, will be tied to Apache...)
* support HTML newsletter
